# Food-Crusher-Timer
My Training supervisor requested me to build a Timer that can be set to 5,10 and 15 minutes. The timer output will be connected to two relays. According to his request the timer should have industrial standards and quality. My supervisor divided the project into smaller parts and requested me to do everything each week. He showed me an Industrial Timer and a Food Crusher which uses it.
Thus, I started using an Arduino Nano for the project which is smaller in size and powerful. I was able to connect the display to this easily.
I designed a code for the timer from scratch and used the U8glib library for the display. The circuit has two push buttons one to select and the other to start.
