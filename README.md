# Food-Crusher-Timer

I started using an Arduino Nano for the project which is smaller in size and compatible with the OLED display. I started to test the OLED display that was ordered. The display too has libraries to be installed I tested the display using the Adafruit library and uploading one of their examples. Next, I started designing the code for the Arduino Nano. At first when writing the code for the timer I used delays to keep the timer working for a certain time but as I wanted to connect a display, I couldn’t use this. The display runs in a continuous do-while loop therefore I did a huge modification to the code. I made the code running the timer from a while loop by using ”millis()” command. To display the seconds count on the display I used a modulus function. Even though the modulus function is the correct way of doing it, it did not work in my situation because the values I am getting are not exact divisible number. I caught this issue by using the “serial print” function. I was able to solve this issue by using a division instead of the modulus. Designing this code properly was the major task for the rest of this code.
